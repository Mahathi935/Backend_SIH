📌 Backend Status – Telemedicine Project


✅ Done

Environment Setup

Node.js + Express installed

Project initialized (package.json)

Auth + Roles

Signup/Login with JWT

Password hashing (bcrypt)

Role-based access control (patient, doctor, admin)

Core APIs

Patients → /patients, /patients/me

Doctors → /doctors, /doctors/me

Appointments → /appointments (doctor + patient flows)

Prescriptions → /prescriptions, /prescriptions/me

Admin Dashboard → /admin/dashboard

File Uploads

Prescription/report upload via Multer

File download served from /uploads/...

Consultation (Video Call Tracking)

/consultation/start (dummy session ID)

/consultation/end/:id (mark session ended)

/consultations (list past calls)

Reminders + Notifications

Appointment creates reminder entry

Cron job (node-cron) logs reminders every 1 min

/reminders endpoint returns upcoming reminders

Integrations (Dummy Mode)

AI Symptom Checker → /symptoms

Pharmacy Stock → /pharmacy/medicines

SMS/OTP → /otp/send (dummy console log)

🔜 Still Pending

SMS Gateway (Real Integration)

Integrate Twilio / MSG91 for actual OTP delivery

Right now: dummy console log only

Phone Call (Voice Consultation)

Add /call/start API with Twilio/Exotel/MSG91 to bridge doctor ↔ patient calls

Currently: only video-consultation session tracking is available

Hosting / Deployment

Deploy backend to cloud (AWS, Azure, or NIC Cloud)

Setup DB connection (Postgres/MySQL) if your teammate finishes schema

Database Integration (if teammate is ready)

Replace dummy in-memory arrays with DB queries

#FRONTEND 
✅ Already Done
Project setup
Created frontend-sih with Next.js.
Installed deps: axios, jwt-decode, react-hook-form.
Installed Tailwind (init done).
Core setup
src/lib/api.js → Axios instance (with token interceptor).
src/context/AuthContext.jsx → Auth provider (login/logout, user state).
Auth
LoginForm.jsx → working login UI.
Doctors
DoctorCard.jsx → card UI for one doctor.
DoctorsList.jsx → fetch & display doctors, open booking form.
⏳ Pending (Next Steps)
Booking system
Create BookAppointment.jsx component (form for date & time).
Integrate with /appointments backend.
Navbar
Navbar.jsx → show “Login” button if logged out, or user info + “Logout” if logged in.
Include in global layout.jsx.
Pages setup
app/layout.jsx → wrap with AuthProvider + Navbar.
app/page.jsx → simple homepage with links.
app/login/page.jsx → renders LoginForm.
app/doctors/page.jsx → renders DoctorsList.
Styling
globals.css → add Tailwind base, components, utilities.
Adjust spacing/colors for UI polish.
Environment
.env.local → set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000.
Register page (optional, but recommended)
Similar to LoginForm, call /auth/register.
Protected route / Dashboard
app/dashboard/page.jsx → show user’s appointments (requires backend).
Video consultation (later milestone)
Either Jitsi embed or integration with Agora/Twilio.
Code cleanup
Add ESLint/Prettier, remove duplicate package-lock.json (to fix Next.js warning).
